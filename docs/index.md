vimix performs **graphical mixing and blending** of several movie clips and
computer generated graphics, with image processing effects in real-time.

Its intuitive and hands-on user interface gives direct control on image opacity and
shape for producing live graphics during concerts and VJ-ing sessions.

The ouput image is typically projected full-screen on an external
monitor or a projector, but can be recorded live (no audio).
