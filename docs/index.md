vimix performs **graphical mixing and blending** of several movie clips and
computer generated graphics, with image processing effects in real-time.

Its intuitive and hands-on user interface gives direct control on image opacity and
shape for producing live graphics during concerts and VJ-ing sessions.

The output image is typically projected full-screen on external monitors 
or projectors, but can be streamed live (SRT) or recorded (without audio).
